# DrunkMonkey
The objective of this project is to create a tool capable of:
- Vendor Agnostic (Multiple Drivers + SDN);
- Discover the Network/Fabric Topology;
- Generate one snapshot of each device in the network/fabric (Configuration, Routing Tables and Mac-Address);
- Emulate failures and expected results;
- Generate real failures;
- Evaluate the network/fabric state during the failures;
