The objective of this project is to create a tool capable of:
- Vendor Agnostic (Multiple Drivers + SDN);
- Discover the Network Topology;
- Generate one snapshot of each device in the network (Configuration, Routing Tables and Mac-Address);
- Emulate failures and results;
- Generate real failures;
- Evaluate the network state during the failures;
